# Parliament Data Processing - Big Data Implementation
## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Big Data platform to process parliamentary data from the website of the Moroccan Parliament. The primary goal is to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the engagement level of each government.

## Project Features
**Data Extraction:** Utilizes Python and BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract parliamentary data.
**Big Data Tools:** Leverages Cloudera distribution, Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, and HBase for scalable and distributed data processing.
**Visualization:** Utilizes PowerBI for creating visualizations and dashboards to interpret and communicate the results effectively.

## Tools Used
**Cloudera:** Big Data platform for data management and processing.
**Python:** Programming language for scripting and data manipulation.
**BeautifulSoup:** Python library for web scraping and data extraction.
**Hadoop:** Distributed storage and processing framework.
**HDFS:** Hadoop Distributed File System for reliable and scalable storage.
**MapReduce:** Programming model for processing large datasets.
**Hive:** Data warehouse infrastructure for querying and managing large datasets.
**HBase:** NoSQL database for real-time, scalable data storage.
**PowerBI:** Business intelligence tool for data visualization and reporting.
